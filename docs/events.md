# Flood events

These are the main records in the risk management system. They provide you with an overview of what is known about flooding and use the criteria from the [flood event searches](./searches.md) to work this out. 

In addition to what is known, you can also add:

* estimates of the number of properties impacted
* details of actions taken (such as sandbags issued)
* comments about the event
* media associated with the incident
* and the record status in terms of whether or not there is a Section 19 report in progress.

You will also have the ability to create a public media upload URL which is really useful in terms of engaging with the public and encouraging them to report properties that were flooded. 

Finally, you can add property level data to the flood event. This would normally be recording actions such as:

* visits to a property
* grants / property protection advice issued
* and anything else required. 

## Section 19 Reports

The flood event record page has been designed to provide a readable narrative about each event. The idea is that you can then use this by exporting it directly to include in a Secton 19 report. 

However, it is expected that users will analyse flooding data in external applications such as GIS and Buisiness Intelligence software external to this application. 

Data feeds and application programing interfaces (API) are available.
