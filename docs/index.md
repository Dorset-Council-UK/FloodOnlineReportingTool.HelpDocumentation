# What is the Flood Online Reporting Tool (FORT)

The flood report tool for risk management authorities (RMA) has been designed to meet the needs of colleagues working within the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) roles. 

This version of FORT is only available to registered users and has been designed to help users to find and collate flood report information from a diverse range of sources. 

You can use the tool to discover reports and group them together. You can then use this information help build a picture of flood events and the impacts they had on communities that were flooded.

The ultimate goal of the application is to help users to create the initial inputs that are used to create a Section 19 report into serious flooding. 

We have provided the following guidance for users:

* [Getting started](./gettingstarted.md)
* [Communicating](./workingtogether.md) with users
* [Setting up](./setup.md) a new system
* Learn more about the [project history](./history.md).
