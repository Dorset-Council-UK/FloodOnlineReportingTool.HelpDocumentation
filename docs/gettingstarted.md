# Getting Started

Users of the system are forced to login as soon as you get to the site. If you are not able to login you will need to get in touch with your site administrator who will configure an account for you. 

Your use of the system will be limited by your agreed user range so that you can only view data protection information within the area defined. 

## Starting page

The first thing page provides you with some basic information about recent flooding incidents within your user range. These are:

* the number of unread property reports 
* the number of new searchs / flood events in the last 30 days
* and whether there are actions waiting for your attention

The blocks on the front page will change colour depending on how your organisation configures the application. These blocks help you instantly get a picture of whether or not there is outstanding management to do. 

We also have provided quick links to the main functions of the application straight off the front page along with the ability to jump back in where you left off. 

## Searching

The two most common starting points are:

1. we have been notified of a new property report via email
1. or we have been made aware of a flooding incident. 

If you have been sent an email notification you can click the link in the notification or search by report ID or postcode using the search box at the top of the home page.

![Search box - allows you to search by reference or postcode](../assets/images/search-box.png)

Both methods will take you straight to the report itself allowing you to view the information provided and trigger actions. See [communicating with users](./workingtogether.md) for more information. 

In the second situation there are two normal response. 

The first would be to create a flood event search and monitor it to see if the number of reports meets the criteria for further investigation. See [flood event searches](./searches.md).

The second would be to create a full flood event record. This is a record of a flood event defined by the data range, responsible organisation and geographical location. These records are used to create the summary data for a potential section 19 report. 
See [flood events](./events.md) for more information.
