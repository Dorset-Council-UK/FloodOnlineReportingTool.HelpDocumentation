# Communicating with users

The system has been designed to create work flows which work with the public flood reporting version of FORT. 

If you create a flood event record which includes a public report it is possible to send notifications to the reporter asking them to fill in the detailed flood report form. 

It is also possible to use the record statuses to relay information to the user, such as links to published section 19 reports and details of advise / grants issued.
