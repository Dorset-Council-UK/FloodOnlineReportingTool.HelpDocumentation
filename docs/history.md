# Project history

The flood reporting tool has been developed by Dorset Council in partnership with many councils and flood risk management organisations across the south west of the UK.

Starting in the early 2000's the Environment Agency provided councils levy funding to develop a tool with the following aims:

* to allow organisations to share best practice
* to ensure that flood reports were consistent 
* to allow easy sharing of this data between partners 
* and to ensure that members of the public don't need to know who is responsible for what

The first iteration of the application, known as Severe Weather Incident Management (SWIM) created a shared set of questions and an agreed spreadsheet format for sharing the data. This was then digitised to create an online form.

Early versions assumed there would be a single version of the truth for each property report and that dates and times would be known but this quickly changed after the system needed to be quickly scaled up for use outside of the southwest. 

This expansion coupled with the need to add historic data led to the need for regionalisation of the data, extensive work on data protection rules and the introduction of multiple sources and approximate dates. 

It was decided to re-build the application using Bootstrap technology and this created the first version of the rebranded FORT application. This was used and developed extensively over the next ten years or so and was recently acknowledged as an example of [good practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigating-a-flood-guidance-for-lead-local-flood-authorities/investigating-a-flood-guidance-for-lead-local-flood-authorities).

This project represents the third iteration of the project and second iteration of the FORT app. 

Over the years the project goals have evolved and so has technology so this current version of FORT is seeking to:

* use the Government Design System (GDS)
* develop using open source technologies where possible 
* adopt modern standards such in authentication and web development, we are using Microsoft technologies
* understand that different organisations will adopt different processes and techonology. 

The final point is perhaps the most important as the new tool is designed much more around the principal of bringing systems together rather than trying to be the one tool to use.
