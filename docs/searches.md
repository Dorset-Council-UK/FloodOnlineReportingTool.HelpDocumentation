# Flood event search

A flood event search is basically the same thing as a full blown flood event record but at this point you are not sure if the criteria for a flood event have been reached. 

You will provide the start and end date of the flooding (if known) along with the geographical area you believe was impacted. 

The area should be a simple polygon or buffer around a known location such as postcode or place name. This needs to be big enough to pick up and property reports as they come in and group them together. 

Finally, you can also select which risk management authorities (RMA) you wish to include from the list:

* Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA)
* Environment Agency (EA)
* Other (including utility companies and other)

## Search results

You will then be presented with a page that summarises how many property reports are known to the system within your search. 

The system will also present you with information about how many properties are within the searched area and try to categorise them. This can be really useful in terms of highlighting high risk properties such as care homes and schools. 

The results screen will tell you if the criteria has been met and provides you with an option to upgrade the record to a full flood event record.

!!! Note, you may need to upgrade before the criteria is met as often you may suspect more properties are impacted than have currently reported. You do not need to wait to upgrade the record.
